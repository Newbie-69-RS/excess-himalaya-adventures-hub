    faqs: [
      { question: "How difficult is the Everest Base Camp Trek?", answer: "The Everest Base Camp Trek is considered moderate to challenging. It involves walking 5-7 hours per day on steep and rocky terrain at high altitudes. Good physical fitness is required, but no technical climbing skills are needed." },
      { question: "Do I need prior trekking experience?", answer: "While prior trekking experience is beneficial, it's not mandatory. However, good physical fitness and regular exercise before the trek are essential. We recommend training with activities like hiking, jogging, or stair climbing for at least 2-3 months before the trek." },
      { question: "What is the best time to trek to Everest Base Camp?", answer: "The best seasons are pre-monsoon (March to May) and post-monsoon (September to November). During these periods, the weather is relatively stable with clear skies, offering excellent mountain views. Winter (December to February) is also possible but can be extremely cold, and summer (June to August) brings monsoon rains, making trails slippery and views often obscured by clouds." },
      { question: "What type of accommodation is available during the trek?", answer: "The trek features teahouse accommodation, which are simple lodges run by local families. Rooms are basic, typically with twin beds and shared bathrooms. As you ascend higher, facilities become more limited. Teahouses provide warm dining areas where meals are served and trekkers can socialize." }
